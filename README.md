+ `/delete partyName1 partyName2...` - forget the parties like it never happened

Use these commands to mention members of needed parties, see the information and manage appereance:

+ `/start` - start the conversation and see welcoming message

+ `/help` - ask for a short usage guide

+ `/list` - show all the existing parties

+ `/rude on/off` - enable RUDE _(Caps Lock)_ mode

You can also tag the party members directly in your message with `@partyName` syntax.
