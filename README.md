**Pull Party Telegram Bot** helps you pulling people up for a party!

## Usage guide

Add [`@PullPartyBot`](https://t.me/PullPartyBot) to the chat to be able to create custom parties and manage them via following commands:

> all commands are not case-sensitive to support RUDE mode \
usernames are char sequences of letters, digits and underscores of 5-32 length

+ `/create partyName user1 user2...` - create new party with mentioned users

    > Users within the party are not repeating \
    Party should consist of at least one user \
    You can enter users with or without `@` symbol \
    `@admins` is a reserved party and already exists \
    Party name should be no longer than 50 characters \
    `@`, `!`, `,`, `,`, `?`, `:`, `;`, `(`, `)` symbols and trailing `-` are not allowed in the party name

+ `/change partyName user1 user2...` - change an existing party

    > Follows all `/create` method's rules \
    You can't change `@admins` party


+ `/delete partyName1 partyName2...` - delete the parties you provided

    > Only admins have access to `/delete` \
    @admins is a reserved party and can't be deleted

+ `/clear` - delete all parties of the chat

    > Follows all `/delete` method's rules

Use these commands to mention members of needed parties, see the information and manage appearance:

+ `@partyName` - syntax for tagging parties implicitly right inside your messages

    > To enable this function you need to grant admins rights to the bot

+ `/party partyName1 partyName2...` - tag the members of existing parties

    > If you mention multiple parties - their members will be gathered in a single message and will have no repeats

+ `/list entry1? entry2?...` - show the parties of the chat and their members

    > Returns all parties on empty input \
    Entries are either users or partyNames: \
        - on the given user shows all parties he is part of \
        - on the given party shows its members \
    List doesn't contain repetitive values \
    Doesn't show `@admins` party

+ `/start` - start the conversation and see welcoming message

+ `/help command?` - ask for a usage guide

    > Provides general guide on empty input \
    Shows command usage guide while argument is given

+ `/rude on/off` - switch RUDE _(Caps Lock)_ mode

    > Set `off` by default \
    Takes only `on` and `off` as correct arguments \
    Doesn't affect error messages

## Tools and libraries
