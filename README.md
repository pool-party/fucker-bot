**Pull Party Telegram Bot** helps you pulling people up for a party!

## Usage guide

Add [`@PullPartyBot`](https://t.me/PullPartyBot) to the chat to be able to create custom parties and manage them via following commands:

> all commands are not case-sensitive to support RUDE mode \
> usernames are char sequences of letters, digits and underscores of 5-32 length

+ `/create partyName user1 user2...` - create party with mentioned users

    > You can enter users with or without `@` symbol \
    You can't create empty party \
    `@admins` party is reserved and already created \
    `@` prefix will be removed from party name \
    `@` symbol is not allowed in party name \
    You can't add single user to one group more than once

+ `/change partyName user2 user3...` - change an existing party

    > Follows all `/create` method's rules \
    You can't change `@admins` party


+ `/delete partyName1 partyName2...` - forget the parties like it never happened

    > Availible only to admins \
    You can't delete `@admins` party

+ `/clear` - forget all the parties in the chat

    > Follows all `/delete` method's rules

Use these commands to mention members of needed parties, see the information and manage appereance:

+ `/start` - start the conversation and see welcoming message

+ `/help` - ask for a short usage guide

+ `/list` - show all the created parties

    > Doesn't show `@admins` party

+ `/rude on/off` - enable RUDE _(Caps Lock)_ mode

    > Set `off` by default \
    Takes only `on` and `off` as correct arguments \
    Doesn't affect error messages

+ `/party partyName1 partyName2...` - mention users according to given parties

You can also tag the party members directly in your message with `@partyName` syntax.
