    Hey! I'm a PullPartyBot!

    I can manage different parties inside your chat and tag their members whenever you need!

    It would be very kind of you to start with creating the group of all members
    Type in `/create all` and follow it with tags of all users
    You can skip this step and simply create parties on your own if you want
